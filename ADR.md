After a lot of trial and Error, I found that it's not possible to decompress the gzip In chunks. Because of this, I have created uithubStars, which is a Vercel processor hosted on uitHubStars, but it's called ForSell gh-archive-processor on GitHub.

The day, week, and month endpoints remain the same. They can just use fetchEach, assuming that the forSale endpoint will always work, which it will because it's Node.js and should be fine. Because now it has a 300-second max timeout instead of just 30.
